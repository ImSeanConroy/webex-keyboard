# webex-keyboard

Custom mini keypad designed to act as a Webex controller making it easily to toggle audio and video whilst on calls. Future versions will resolve minor issues, have more keys and an improved PCB design, potentially moving away from pre-built development boards to further reduce the keypads overall footprint.
